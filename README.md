Match four consecutive tiles to win

Gameplay
=======

The computer randomly decides who goes first and which color your given. Your objective is to match four consecutive tiles of your
color either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

Select a column to put your tile in. Then it will be your opponent's turn.

If all cells in the board are filled with tiles and there is no horizontal, vertical or diagonal combination of four consecutive
tiles of the same color, the game will end in a draw.
